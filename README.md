# Oath
Affliction tracking, class detection, dynamic priorities.
*NOTE: This is for duelling only. This will not be of use in group scenarios.*

## Installation
Please see the releases page on the right. 

## About
 - The package tracks your afflictions, and outputs them in a little prompt tag.
 - It will relay affliction gain and loss, and responds to fresh information from a DIAGNOSE.
 - The package tracks which classes are attacking you. It comes with some triggers for class detection, but you will need to add more.
 - If you take a look at the scripts you'll find functions for dynamically swapping priorities based on a variety of factors. A simple dynamic swap function for defending against waterlord comes with the package, as does an empty template.

## Aliases
 - "*ra*" resets your afflictions. 
 - "*op*" pauses/unpauses class detection and dynamic priorities on a toggle.
